          You have made a decision of taking the path on the right. Lucky you! Due to your magnificent intuition you have WON THE GAME!!!!!! Instead of the bag having instructions that will lead you to the jewel, this bag contained the jewel as well. After you found this jewel you were sent back home with 5,000,000,000,000,000 dollars and was given a crown for being the most amazing human being on the planet. You can choose to play agin if you would like.

          Sadly, as you made a typical decision by keeping the bag closed, you missed out on a major chance to win the game. This choice of picking wrongly left you standed in the jungle for the next 50 years of your life. After 50 years a gorilla family climbed down from all the trees to (verbally) tell you that you made a mistake and that you'll never find the jewel. Although you lost, you can always play again and have another shot at finding the jewel!

          As you have used your magnificent intuition, you have won the game. You are a very persistant person who rather adventure further instead of sleeping and hoping for something else. Because of your decision making, the people who kidnapped you in the jungle decised to find you and recognize you foryour persistance. Not only did they give you an award but they gave you 3,000,000,000,000,000,000 dollars. CONGRADULATIONS!!! If you wish, you can happily play again.

          You have made a decision of sleeping and hoping. This is not a smart nor wise decision. As you were sleeping and hoping, a bunch of tigers walkked up to you. They not only didn't like how you were living in their jungle but you also were disrespecting the space by walking on two feet. Due to this, the family of tigers put you in a very small boat with only 2 cans of food and 4 cups of water. As you began to drift, you didn't get far because later a bunch of piranhas jumped on your boat and that was the end of you. THE END! If you would like to test your luck and intuition please play again!
